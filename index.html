					I am a junior at the Academy for Math Engineering and Science, and I am very interested in software development. 
					I currently lead the software branch of the FRC team at my school, the AMES Amperes. In addition to my work with the team, 
					I have worked on a variety of other projects on my own, as well as in groups. In school, I take and excel in 
					advanced classes, including concurrent enrollment classes from the University of Utah.

				I joined my school's robotics team, the Amperes, team 3243, in 2022. My first experience was preseason, where we created robots to complete a
				simple challenge in a competition hosted by the school. My small group was able to achive 2nd at this competition of
				around 20 teams, which we were very happy with. Next we moved on to the real season. I was part of the programming
				subteam, and I helped program an extendable and pivotable arm, with a wrist rolling and pitching wrist on the end.
				I used a variety of methods within the library for FRC, WPILib. We program in Java, and I gained much of my Java experience
				through working on the robot. We participated in two regional competitions that year, and won some small awards in each.

				After the 2023 season, I was given the position of software lead, and I immediately set to work. I worked with our software
				team to organize and work on a number of interseason projects to try and improve our team's strength and culture. We worked
				on lessons for incoming programmers to try and reduce the barrier to entry of the programming team. We worked on documenting
				our knowledge and past experience for those who came next. We also developed what code we could before the season started.
				In the 2023 preseason I worked alongside the rest of the software team to include and support our new members of the programming
				team, which included teaching lessons about programming, checking in and providing support when needed for programming the
				preseason robots, and even having the programming team over for a game night on occasion.

			Graphing Calculator
		</h3>
		<div class="elementPair"> <div class="left">
			<p>
				In this project, I made a graphing calculator for a pair project in my AP CS principles class. 
				I wrote the parser routine, evaluation routine, and graphing framework. My partner wrote the 
				app navigation. I used a recursive object structure in JavaScript to repersent an expression 
				typed in by the user, whether on the graphing or evaluation screen. Each object held two other 
				objects, as well as the operation to combine them with. The objects held could be other expressions,
				or a terminating x or constant. The parser would translate a string mathematical expression and use
				order of operations to generate an expression object. An expression is evaluated by recursively traversing
				the expression object and combining its components using its operation.

				For my AP CS principles final project, I created a adventure game taking place in a procedurally
				generated maze. The project was written in Python, and I used the object oriented paradigm to organize
				the code. The player was a singleton, the enemies were classes extending a base enemy class, and so on
				for most elements in the game. It taught me a lot about code organization and problems with python.
				If I were to come back to this project, there are quite a few things I would fix, such as a lack of 
				gameplay diversity, strange pacing, and the amount of grind. Overall, I'm still quite happy with the project.

			Relative Faith

			<p>
				Relative Faith was a video game I worked on with a group as a part of a game development class. In it,
				you platform between planets, with one catch: the speed of light is very low. I wrote the relativistic physics
				for this project, which involved making a modular script that would take in data from a game object about its
				true velocity and forces, and puppeteer it to the correct position. Not only was this my first Godot project, it
				was also my first time working with shader languages. Godot has a shader language similar to GLSL, and I used this
				to attempt to implement length contraction, light travel distortion, and the dopler effect, but unfortunately, I
				was never able to get it to work properly before reaching the deadline for the project and moving on.

			<p>
				In this project, I wrote a 3D graphing engine in the 2D graphing calculator Desmos. It taught me a lot about graphics
				and rendering. The program in Desmos takes a list of verticies, as well as a list of triangles in terms of the indicies
				of the relevant verticies, and generates a 2D triangle and color for each for Desmos to plot. I also performed backface
				culling, and then sorted the triangles to preserve the correct occlusion of one by another. I enjoy working around
				strange restrictions, and Desmos provides plenty of these. For example, there are no nested arrays, 2D arrays, or 3D
				points in Desmos. This meant I had to use three lists for the verticies—one for the x, the y, and the z. In addition, 
				I wrote a small python script to convert a .obj file into the relevant lists in a format I could import into Desmos.

				I wrote this website in raw HTML from the ground up. I had taken a "Creative Coding" class in middle school, which covered
				HTML and CSS, but making this website has taught me much more about them. I decided to write it from scratch rather than
				use a framework because I thought it would teach me more about frontend development, which I have done very little of. I
				invite you to poke around this website with your browser's inspector and take a look!
