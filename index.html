			Graphing Calculator

			<p>
				In this project, I made a graphing calculator for a pair project in my AP CS principles class. 
				I wrote the parser routine, evaluation routine, and graphing framework. My partner wrote the 
				app navigation. I used a recursive object structure in JavaScript to represent an expression 
				typed in by the user, whether on the graphing or evaluation screen. Each object held two other 
				objects, as well as the operation to combine them with. The objects held could be other expressions,
				or a terminating x or constant. The parser would translate a string mathematical expression and use
				order of operations to generate an expression object. An expression is evaluated by recursively traversing
				the expression object and combining its components using its operation.

				For my AP CS principles final project, I created an adventure game taking place in a procedurally
				generated maze. The project was written in Python, and I used the object oriented paradigm to organize
				the code. The player was a singleton, the enemies were classes extending a base enemy class, and so on
				for most elements in the game. It taught me a lot about code organization and problems with python.
				If I were to come back to this project, there are quite a few things I would fix, such as a lack of 
				gameplay diversity, strange pacing, and the amount of grind. Overall, I'm still quite happy with the project.

				Relative Faith was a video game I worked on with a group as a part of a game development class. In it,
				you platform between planets, with one catch: the speed of light is very low. I wrote the relativistic physics
				for this project, which involved making a modular script that would take in data from a game object about its
				true velocity and forces, and puppeteer it to the correct position. Not only was this my first Godot project, it
				was also my first time working with shader languages. Godot has a shader language similar to GLSL, and I used this
				to attempt to implement length contraction, light travel distortion, and the doppler effect, but unfortunately, I
				was never able to get it to work properly before reaching the deadline for the project and moving on.

			<p>
				In this project, I wrote a 3D graphing engine in the 2D graphing calculator Desmos. It taught me a lot about graphics
				and rendering. The program in Desmos takes a list of vertices, as well as a list of triangles in terms of the indices
				of the relevant vertices, and generates a 2D triangle and color for each for Desmos to plot. I also performed backface
				culling, and then sorted the triangles to preserve the correct occlusion of one by another. I enjoy working around
				strange restrictions, and Desmos provides plenty of these. For example, there are no nested arrays, 2D arrays, or 3D
				points in Desmos. This meant I had to use three lists for the verticesâ€”one for the x, the y, and the z. In addition, 
				I wrote a small python script to convert a .obj file into the relevant lists in a format I could import into Desmos.

				I wrote this website in raw HTML from the ground up. I had taken a "Creative Coding" class in middle school, which covered
				HTML and CSS, but making this website has taught me much more about them. I decided to write it from scratch rather than
				use a framework because I thought it would teach me more about frontend development, which I have done very little of. I
				invite you to poke around this website with your browser's inspector and take a look! I can't promise good comments though,
				it's just me working on this project.
